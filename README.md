This is a cpp calculator program

The aim is to be able to enter an unspecified amount of numbers and whatever operations you want and have the output follow the rules of BIDMAS (or BODMAS or PEMDAS depending on where you are from)
like a scientific calculator

There is no purpose to this program other than I am experimenting with my knowledge of cpp and thought it'd be an enjoyable project
